1. when you first load the project into intellij, it is not built 
2. built meaning some of the resources are not build and are not available to the project, 
   like for example the petclinic.css, and thats y the project looks "bland"
3. so what you need to do is a maven clean, and then a maven package, and the project will be built,
and the resources will be made available to the project
4. start up the app again
